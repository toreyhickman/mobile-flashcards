# Flashcards
This applicaiton was created as part of the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. Users can create decks of flashcards, and cards to decks, and play the decks.

## Running the Application
- Install node packages with `yarn install`.
- Open the application with `yarn start`.

## Notes
The application starts with no pre-defined decks.  You will have to create a deck before the deck list is populated.  Decks are created with no cards, and you must add a card to a deck before it can be played.

The application was tested with the iOS simulator.
